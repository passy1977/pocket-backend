## Purpose and Scope
This document provides a technical introduction to the Pocket backend system, a secure data management and synchronization platform. The Pocket backend enables clients to store, retrieve, and synchronize structured data through encrypted communication channels. This overview explains the system's architecture, key components, and functionality.
Purpose and Scope

The Pocket backend serves as the server-side component for client applications requiring secure storage and synchronization of hierarchical data structures. It provides:
* Secure authentication and session management
* Data storage and retrieval with change tracking
* Cross-device data synchronization
* Encryption of sensitive information
* REST API and IPC socket interfaces

For detailed information about the API interfaces, see API Reference, and for the authentication system, see Authentication and Session Management.
